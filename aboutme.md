My name is Martín Caballero. I am a system software engineer that:

- Love to make cool projects programming on different languages
- Love to learn new stuff trying to keep up with the hot tech

### My background

Information Systems Engineering, graduated from the National Technologic University of my town.

I am an advanced grails developer, technology that I like a lot and have been doing for a long time. I like to work on the frontend as well, feeling really confortable using AngularJS and Angular 2+ and frameworks like Bootstrap and Ionic. I also worked on native applications on Android and IOS using Swift (but very basic knowledge).

I am a freelancer since three years ago, and I have two projects on my own with a couple of happy clients using them.

From Villa María, Córdoba, Argentina.

I helped on the development of a couple of open source projects like the grails-field plugin, but I feel I can do it much better on the future involving a little more on other projects as well.
